## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v20.12.1
- npm 10.5.0
- PostgreSQL

### Setup

Clone the repository and install the dependencies for both frontend and backend:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sammy0807/WR_Assessment.git
# Navigate into the repository
cd WR_Assessment
# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
# Install backend dependencies
cd ../backend
npm install
```

### Configuration

Configure your environment variables in the backend:

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend
# Create a .env file and add the following
echo "DATABASE_URL=your_postgress_database_url" > .env
echo "PORT=your_preferred_port_number" >> .env
```

Replace `your_postgress_database_url` with your PostgreSQL database URL and `your_preferred_port_number` with the port number you want the server to use.

### Configure Environment Variables in the Frontend

To ensure that your frontend application can communicate with the backend server, you need to set up an environment variable to define the backend's URL and port. Use the same port number that you used for the backend.

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the `frontend` folder (if it does not exist).
3. Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `your_preferred_port_number` with the port number you set for the backend server in the backend `.env` file.

```bash
# In the frontend directory
echo "REACT_APP_BACKEND_PORT=your_preferred_port_number" > .env
```

### Run the Application

To start the server, use:

```bash
# Start the backend server
npm run dev
```

Navigate to the frontend directory to start the React app:

```bash
# Start the frontend application
cd ../frontend
npm start
```

## Testing

For testing, run:

```bash
# Testing the backend
cd backend
npm test
# Testing the frontend
cd ../frontend
npm test
```
